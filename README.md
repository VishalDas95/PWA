# PWA
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user
functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to
native mobile applications.
PWAs are an emerging technology that combine the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers to provide benefits
of a rich mobile experience.

This project was made during the DevFest18' by GDG Jalandhar.
